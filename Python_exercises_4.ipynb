    "## Question1 \n",
    "Write a function `trapez()` that computes the area of a trapezoid. Here is the formula: `A = (1/2)(b1+b2)h`. In the formula b1 is the length of one of the bases, b2 the other. The height is h and the area is A. Basically, this takes the average of the two bases times the height. For a rectangle b1 = b2, so this reduces to b1*h. This means that you can do a pretty good test of the correctness of your function using a rectangle (that way you can compute the answer in your head). Use input statements to ask for the bases and the height.\n",
    "Convert these input strings to real numbers using `float()`. Print the output nicely EXACTLY like mine below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Be careful that your output on the test case below is exactly as shown so that the testing function judges your output correctly.  The testing function does not look at your input statements, so you don't have to use my input prompts if you don't want to. However, testing function will enter the three inputs in the order shown. See the other test run below.\n",
